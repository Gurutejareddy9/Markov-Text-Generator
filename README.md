## About the Project
This project leverages the Markov Chain principle to create new text that mimics the style of a provided source text. Ideal for creative writing, understanding probabilistic modeling, or simply for fun.

## How Markov Chain Works
The algorithm analyzes sequences of characters (or words) in the source text and predicts the next character based on the probability of sequences appearing together.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `python markov_text_generator.py`.
3. Enter or paste your source text when prompted.
4. View the generated text.

## Customization
- **Chain Length**: Modify the `chain_length` parameter in `MarkovTextGenerator` to change the sequence length analyzed by the algorithm. Default is 2.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome. Please fork, modify, and submit a pull request.
